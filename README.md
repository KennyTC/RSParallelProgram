# RSParallelProgram

Analysis of data using RoughSet and Hadoop's Map-Reduce.
- By using MapReduce, the calculation of `Reducts` in RoughSet is faster and more efficient.
- Map-Reduce allows RoughSet can deal with large data, which is nearly impossible with the original RoughSet
- The implementation is in Python
